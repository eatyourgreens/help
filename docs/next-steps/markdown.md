# Markdown

Here's a few tips that work everywhere we support the Markdown syntax, e.g. pages, tutorials, the project description...

## Displaying and Resizing Embedded Images

You can upload images to Panoptes and display them anywhere the Project Builder allows markdown. Tutorials, help, the field guide, and even as icons. Hereâ€™s Galaxy Zoo adding icons to each answer using transparent .png images:


![Galaxy Zoo Task: Disc or Smooth or Artifact?](/img/disc-or-smooth.png)

But what if your image is stupidly large to use as an icon, or much too small for the field guide?

Panoptes has a special version of markdown that lets you specify the image dimensions to display. Copy the markdown string from the Media tab, then add `={pixel_width}x{pixel_height` (or `={pixel_width}x` to fix width and maintain original dimensions) just before the last bracket. For example:

`![image.png](https://panoptes-uploads.zooniverse.org/project_attached_image/<hashed-file-name>.jpeg) =60x)` 

will display a square image resized to 60 by 60 pixels.

This also works for an image you host yourself - just update the URL to any publically accessible address.
